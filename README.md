## Lody w Warszawie â€“ Geospatial data analysis of ice cream venues in Warsaw

### Description

As average temperatures rise on an yearly basis in Warsaw, selling ice cream is the type of business that can bring significant profits, especially in the heated summer months. Natural ice cream (or "lody naturalne", as locals call it) is becoming more and more popular and **entreprenuers** with very well crafted recipes and marketing strategies are asking "where should I open my shop?", as the **location of the shop could exponentially impact the returns**.

Through this project, I intend to help such entrepreneurs make the right decision when it comes to choosing the location to open their shop using **geospatial data visualisation** such as **choropleth maps** and **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) heatmaps**.
